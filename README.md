### Project Description: ###

The Restaurant Reservation App is a streamlined solution for restaurant managers to effectively oversee and manage reservations. It equips restaurant staff with the ability to view and organize reservations by date, seamlessly update reservation statuses, and assign guests to tables. The app features a comprehensive dashboard displaying a dynamic overview of both reservations and table statuses. Additionally, it empowers restaurant teams with tools to efficiently search for, create new reservations, and add new tables, thereby enhancing the overall management of dining operations.
